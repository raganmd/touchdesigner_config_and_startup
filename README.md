## Overview
Configuration on multi server systems is by far one of the most complicated pieces of the digital arts puzzle that I've fought with over the last year. There are countless ways to approach this particular problem - and if you already have a handle on this issues then this example isn't for you. If, however, you find yourself scratching your head about where to get started there are a few things to consider.

### Organization Matters
Working with one machine might seem hard now, but once you start working with 10+ it gets even stranger. Many touch programmers start by initially building individual toe files for each machine - this, however, has it's limits and it's quickly impractical to think about making a general change in all of those toe files for a simple update. 

How to work then? 

The component TOX file for TouchDesigner provides a wonderful solution for this issue. You can quickly begin to think about a modular system that relies on a series of tox files for it's configuration that are all loaded on demand. That seems simple enough, but there's still a larger question of how to organize these files in a meaningful way. This is where a system configuration processes comes into play.
